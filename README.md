git clone <your-repository-url>
cd course-buddy
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5001
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

## üìä Database Schema

### User Model
```javascript
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  personalEmail: String,
  password: String,
  completed_courses: [String],
  isVerified: Boolean
}
```

### Professor Model
```javascript
{
  name: String,
  courses_offered: [String],
  overall_quality: Number,
  would_take_again: Number,
  difficulty: Number,
  rmp_link: String
}
```
